## Highlights
- Let me summarize them for you:
  Right-align your numbers
  Left-align your texts
  Use decimals appropriately (one or two is often enough)
  Display units (e.g., $, %) sparsely (e.g., only on first row)
  Highlight outliers
  Highlight column headers
  Use subtle highlights and dividers
  Use white space between rows and columns
  Use white space (or dividers) to highlight groups
  Use visualizations for large tables
