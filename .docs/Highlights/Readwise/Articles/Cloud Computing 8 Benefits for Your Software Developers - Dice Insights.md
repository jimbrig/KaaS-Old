- The use of serverless computer networks has proven to help many companies provide more on-demand computer system resources. These resources on a serverless network include data storage and power for many computers in a network. The development of serverless computing has enabled many businesses to save money as well as have better access to certain data. Serverless computing has also allowed companies and individuals to use computers that run better with the enhanced power provided. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1434780891/17134201))
- 8 benefits of the cloud for software developers ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1434780891/17134205))
- 1. Scalability
  One of the main benefits of cloud computing is scalability. With traditional server hosting, users need to determine the exact hardware that each node of the system would run a particular web application or server. With cloud systems, users can now scale any part of an application more quickly and easily. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1434780891/17134207))
- 2. Cost
  Another benefit of cloud computing systems is that the cost is much less. Companies and users will be able to save money on computing costs as they will not need any upfront investment and will be able to pay as they go to get the resources they need.
