## Highlights
- It’s easy to start a project. For a lot of us, finishing projects is the difficult bit. Here’s my guide to completing tasks.
- “Decide on your most important task. Begin immediately and work on that task with self-discipline until it is 100% complete. In life, all success comes from completing tasks. It’s not from working at tasks, it’s from completing tasks. It is only when you complete tasks that you become successful.”
  – Brian Tracy
