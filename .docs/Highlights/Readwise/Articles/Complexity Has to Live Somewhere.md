## Highlights
- only complexity can handle complexity ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1353714206/14341693))
- This cannot be avoided. Complexity has to live somewhere. It's always a part of people solving problems, whether you realize it or not. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1353714206/14341697))
- Complexity doesn't lay dormant. It is part of everyone's learning experience, and they adapt to it. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1353714206/14341699))
- "Knowledge in the head" and "knowledge in the world" ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1353714206/14341702))
- Knowledge in the head are things you know, that you have learned, that are in your memory. Knowledge in the world is everything else: information written down, cues in design (you know the power button by looking at its symbol, and you know it can be pressed because it looks like a button). One tricky thing is that interpretation of knowledge in the world is both cultural and contextual, and relies on knowledge in the head (you know the power button can be pressed because you know what a button is in the first place).

- The trap is insidious in software architecture. When we adopt something like microservices, we try to make it so that each service is individually simple. But unless this simplicity is so constraining that your actual application inherits it and is forced into simplicity, it still has to go somewhere. If it's not in the individual microservices, then where is it? ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1353714206/14341705))
- Complexity has to live somewhere. If you are lucky, it lives in well-defined places. In code where you decided a bit of complexity should go, in documentation that supports the code, in training sessions for your engineers. You give it a place without trying to hide all of it. You create ways to manage it. You know where to go to meet it when you need it. If you're unlucky and you just tried to pretend complexity could be avoided altogether, it has no place to go in this world. But it still doesn't stop existing.
