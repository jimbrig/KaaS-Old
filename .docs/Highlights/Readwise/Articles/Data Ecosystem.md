## Highlights
- Data can be categorized as structured semi-structured, or unstructured.
- Structured data can be organized into rows and columns an example of structured data is spreadsheets.
- Semi-structured data is a mix of data that has consistent characteristics and data that doesnâ€™t conform to a rigid structure. For example, emails. An email has a mix of structured data, such as the name of the sender and recipient, but also has the contents of the email, which is unstructured data.
- Unstructured data: Data that is complex, and mostly qualitative information that is impossible to reduce to rows and columns. For example, photos, videos, text files, PDFs, and social media content.
