## Highlights
- I have customized this format to my needs, I have the following lists:
  Personal
  Work
  Someday / Maybe
  List per big project I have (either personal or work related)
- On top of these lists I have several tags according to where I’m suppose to do them:
  @Office
  @Call
  @Errands (i.e. by groceries)
  @Internet
  @Email
  @Home
  @Blog
  Each task can have additional tag
  na (Next Actions) – the task is not dependant on other task to complete.
  wait (Waiting For) – other task need to be completed before I can finish this task
