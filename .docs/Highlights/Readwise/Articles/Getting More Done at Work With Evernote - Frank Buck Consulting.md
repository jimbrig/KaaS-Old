## Highlights
- Once you determine your Life Categories, next comes the four tenets of your ongoing Getting More Done practice:
  focus – different than mental attention, in this context, this is the decision to prioritize one routine over others to achieve mastery,
  routine – habitual behaviors connected together,
  accountability – finding the right type and amount of personal or social motivation, and
  taking action – organizing the rest of your life around your routines.
- In order to get more done, determine the single role or ongoing project that will be your focus for some period of time until you develop focus mastery.
- Fitness is stretching your “work muscles” regularly. In GMD, each Fitness—physical, emotional, mental, sleep/rest, nutrition, social and rejuvenation—is a focus mastery project by itself.
