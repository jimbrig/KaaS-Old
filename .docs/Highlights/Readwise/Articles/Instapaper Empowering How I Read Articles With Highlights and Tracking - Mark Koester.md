## Highlights
- While I may not always read it in the app, I do my best to save and archive what I read once a day. This means nearly every important article I read online is captured and tracked. That way I have a decent record and count of my reading habits. We will look more at the tracking part shortly.
- I have researched and tried some of these tools, like Liner, but never found the experience very good across devices and systems.
- The other nice thing about Instapaper is Search.
- Tracking Your Article Reading and Highlights with IFTTT and QS Ledger
- Instapaper and IFTTT have a really great integration that makes it possible to keep a log of every article you save, read and like.
- t can be used to understand how you sleep, your exercise behavior, or how much time you spend on the computer or listening to music. It can also be used to pull data on what articles you read from both Pocket and Instapaper. Each project and integration includes a data downloader and data analysis notebook.
- After youâ€™ve got your data, I recommend you checkout the Instapaper data analysis notebook which provides a good way to look at your reading history.
- Creating a Heatmap of Daily Articles Read in Instapaper
