## Highlights
- I tend to think that everything we do should be integrated in some way that gives us a feeling of connectedness with our own routine. It is possible to join projects, learning ventures as well as work tasks, as part of a bigger and more integrated process that constitutes our workflow.
- This principle, which I first heard about on this paper by Francis Heylighen and Clément Vidal discussing the famous Get Things Done method by David Allen, relates to the idea of exploiting opportunities rather than relying on tight schedules.
- The authors, while attempting to provide a scientific backing to the ideas present in Allen’s book, argue that, because our brain developed to adapt quickly to the environment, our perception is tuned for recognizing disturbances and affordances - opportunities to solve problems.
