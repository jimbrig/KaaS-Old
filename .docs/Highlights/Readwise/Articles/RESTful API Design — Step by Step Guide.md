## Highlights
- All teams will henceforth expose their data and functionality through service interfaces
- Teams must communicate with each other through these interfaces
- There will be no other form of interprocess communication allowed — no direct linking, no direct reads of another team’s data store, no shared-memory model, no back doors whatsoever. The only communication allowed is via service interface calls over the network.
