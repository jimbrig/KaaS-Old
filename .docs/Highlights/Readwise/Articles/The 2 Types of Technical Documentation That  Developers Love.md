## Highlights
- API documentation refers to the description of classes and methods in frameworks and libraries. The REST API is another example that’s expected to have well-formulated documentation
- Now, ask yourself how often do you write documentation for the cases mentioned above. Do you write in the comments what each class does? Do all your REST methods have a place where all possible responses defined?
- need to know who the end-user of the product is.
- Documenting the approach or flow helps you to design the final product. It enables sharing the understanding within the team of how the entire system works — for instance, how the whole payment system works. Otherwise, some important details, like why payment verification is mandatory, could be missing or wrongly interpreted.
