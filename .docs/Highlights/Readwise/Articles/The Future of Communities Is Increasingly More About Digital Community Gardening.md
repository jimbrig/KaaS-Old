## Highlights
- The phrase "digital garden" is a metaphor for thinking about writing and creating that focuses less on the resulting "showpiece" and more on the process, care, and craft it takes to get there.
- A digital garden for me is about moving away from the idea of a blog (or even a newsletter like this ðŸ˜¬), where the posts are displayed chronologically and with a focus on perfection.
