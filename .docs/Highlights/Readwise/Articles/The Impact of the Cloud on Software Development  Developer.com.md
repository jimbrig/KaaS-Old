## Highlights
- The following are just some of the areas that Cloud service providers offer to developers:
  Compute: Compute provides the ability to run applications and services on the Cloud provider’s systems. This gives developers computing power without the need to invest in their own servers.
  Container Support: Container Support includes the ability to host and run containers such as Docker.
  Content Delivery: Content delivery includes the ability to distribute content, including placing objects on the Cloud “edge.”
  Database Services: Database services include scalable databases and database services with features such as SSD storage for fast access, data redundancy, data pipelines, access to relation and other database systems, and much more.
  Deployment: Many Cloud providers also offer continuous deployment services, as well as the ability to create automated deployments.
  Machine Learning: Services that help to drive machine learning and artificial intelligence are more recent additions for many Cloud providers.
  Management: As Cloud services and functions have increased, the ability to control and manage those Cloud services has been added. This can range from connecting to Microsoft Active Directory to configuring compliance, security, scalability, authentication, and other services.
  Mobile Services: Mobile services provide access to configure mobile apps and work with mobile app features such as notification services, user authentication, data storage, push notifications, analytics, and more.
  Networking: Networking services can include domain name services, virtual private networking, load balancing, and more.
  Storage: Storage was one of the earlier features provided, and generally includes the ability to do private backup and recovery along with the storage and hosting of data. This can include long-term storage options, high redundancy storage, and more.
  Web Site Management: The ability to manage DNS services, Web services, and more is also available from many Cloud providers. This also can include Web hosting as well as associated features such as analytics, data management, and more.
  Analytics: Analytics includes the ability to tap into business intelligence, analytics, and visualization tools.
  Application Services: Application services include features such as the ability to tap into Web service APIs and more. This can include services such as video and game streaming to providing e-mail, notifications, workflow, SMS, or any other types of app services.
