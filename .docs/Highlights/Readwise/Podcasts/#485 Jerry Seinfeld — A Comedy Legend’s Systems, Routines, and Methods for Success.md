## Highlights
- Speaker 1: I mean, I don't know. A lot of my life is I don't like getting depressed. I get depressed a lot. I hate the feeling and these routines the these very difficult routines, whether it's exercise or writing, and both of them are things where it's like it's, it's brutal. That's another thing I was explaining to my daughter. She's She's frustrated that writing is so difficult because no one told her that it's the most difficult thing in the world. It's the most difficult thing in the world is to write. People tell you to write like you could do it like you're supposed to be able to do it. Nobody can do it. It's impossible. The greatest people in the world can't do it. So if you're going to do it, you should first be told. What you are attempting to do is incredibly difficult. One of the most difficult things there is way harder than weight training way harder, what you're summoning, trying to summon within ([Time 0:51:04](https://www.airr.io/quote/600fd16fbe5965dfd5dab63f))
    - Note: Writing sucks duck
