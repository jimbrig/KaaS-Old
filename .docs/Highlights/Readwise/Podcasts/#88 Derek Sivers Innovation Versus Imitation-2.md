## Highlights
- their content. But I'm just me and I don't need that complexity. So I think that this is a nice metaphor for life. It doesn't have to be so complex. You can do just what's best for you, not need to adopt the legacy software that everyone else uses. That's really interesting. I mean, so two themes stuck it to me. They're the complexity theme, but also the imitation versus innovation. If you don't imitate, I mean, one of the byproducts of that that I can see is you're going slower, like you probably take you longer to do that than it would have to download WordPress. And that goes back, maybe to the complexity right where they're intertwined ([Time 0:10:57](https://www.airr.io/quote/5f37251aa7c7e0ae7199a898))
    - Note: Simplicity for you, don’t take on the accidental complexity that others have
