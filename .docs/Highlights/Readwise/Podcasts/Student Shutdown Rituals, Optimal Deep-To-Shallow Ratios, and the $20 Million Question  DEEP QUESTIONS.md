## Highlights
- Speaker 0: And then you say Okay, how do I do? A little bit better next time. Next time you're gonna write a bad paper. But it could be slightly less bad. You try as hard as you can. You push yourself. You're deliberately practicing. You wanted to get accepted at the best place. You Can you take the review seriously? You take the feedback seriously, you do the best you can. The next paper is a little bit less bad. The next paper is a little bit less bad than that. At some point, you look up and say Huh? This paper that was a little bit less bad than the last one is actually pretty good. And then after a while you're like, Yeah, I write good papers. Keep pushing yourself better venues, more citations, better topics and you go from Hey, I write good papers to I write really good paper. So that's how you get there. You start by writing bad papers, and you get better each time. ([TimeÂ 0:15:29](https://www.airr.io/quote/5fc53237bb807d709030a582))
