## Notes

- Piling up stacks of information and content until the stack grows intimidatingly large and unmanageable directly leads to one's ignorance later on to intentionally disregard and ignore that stack of resources.
- Similarly, when it comes to managing bookmarks. We stumble upon an interesting web page and don’t want to lose the information, thus we keep it as a bookmark. The digital pile of bookmarks isn’t any different from a tangible pile of papers we consider worth knowing. **Kept isn’t Read**.
- Just like photocopying is self-rewarding and addictive, I argue that we fall into the same trap of false comfort when we bookmark web pages and sort the bookmarks into folders or tagged categories. Bookmarking a web page is satisfying because we get rid of the fear of losing access to the information.

To counter this resulting outcome derived from the [[The Collector's Fallacy]], see [[Rinse and Repeat - Research, Read, Assimilate]].
