What does knowledge processing mean to you? Have you ever reflected on the meaning and purpose behind the processing of information and [[Literary Notes/Information Flow]]mation Flow]]?

Processing forces one to think critically, categorize ideas, relate them to similar ideas, and come up with metaphors/analogies/stories to better convey those ideas. In other words, **The Process Improves Thinking**.

The Process solidifies thoughts you deem worthy of remembering, and by working The Process, you strengthen the ability to recall those worthy things in your life. **The Process Strengthens Memory.**

Most importantly, it’s not the destination but the journey. Or put another way, the journey IS the destination. When I was young, my dad said we could open presents a day early if we solved his riddle. I chewed on the riddle trying to solve it. It was riveting to have a good riddle. Then my brother emerged from the computer room (having just been on the internet) and he blurted out the answer. You’d think I would have been happy to open presents; but instead I was disappointed because I was robbed of a juicy riddle. It’s not the answer, it’s the riddle itself that matters. Or put another way, the riddle IS the answer. It’s a means unto itself, full of its own joy and fulfillment. **The Process is Fulfilling.**
