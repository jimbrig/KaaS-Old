# About KaaS - Knowledge as a Service

`KaaS` (Knowledge as a Servi[[Placeholders/Obsidian]]Obsidian]] Vault composed of a multitude of notes, w[[Placeholders/Markdown]]Markdown]], t[[Placeholders/Version Control]] Contr[[Placeholders/Git]]th [[[[Placeholders/GitHub]][[GitHub]], published onl[[Placeholders/GitHub Actions]] Acti[[Placeholders/MkDocs]][[MkDocs]], and hosted on my personal domain *jimbrig.com*.

Inside is my personal, customized, digital knowledge notebase structured l[[Literary Notes/Zettelkasten]]ttelkasten]], a collection of [[Placeholders/Atomic Notes]]omic Notes]] about anything that interests me.

Consider this my *Digital Garden*. It is a garden that needs to be maintained and cared for overtime to produce fruitful outcomes.

## Structure

### Note Types

- [[Plans/Daily/README]]: Daily notes for journaling and reflection
- [[Literary Notes/README]]: Notes representing external ideas and knowledge that I have captured.
- [[Permanent Notes/README]]: Notes that are considered *Evergreen*, i.e., notes that I have curated and formulated.
- [[Concept Notes]]: Notes that are just describing or defining a concept or idea.
- [[Placeholders/README|Structural Notes or Placeholders]]: Structure notes are notes that organize other notes
- Source Notes: similar to Literary Notes, but denote a structure specific to a type of input/source:
	- Article
	- Post
	- Video
	- Podcast
	- Mindsweep
	- Code Snippet
	- Repository

These sources are maintained using Obsidian's Tagging feature and currently I have the following nested tags under root tag `#Type/`:
- `#Type/Article`
- `#Type/Book`
- `#Type/Video`
- `#Type/Podcast`
- `#Type/Idea`
- `#Type/Project`
- `#Type/Mindsweep`
- `#Type/Code`
- `#Type/WriteUp`
- `#Type/Diagram`

Other types that aren't necessarily *sources*:

- `#Type/MOC`
- `#Type/Daily`
- `#Type/Meta`
- `#Type/Framework`
-
