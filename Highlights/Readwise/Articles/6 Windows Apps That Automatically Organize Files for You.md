  There is a separate tab called Log to help you keep track and check if it’s working correctly or not.
- Listary is an excellent search utility app to quickly find files.
- Listary seamlessly integrates with Open and Save Dialog Box to quickly open and save files. You can search for files to open within any app that uses the Open File dialog.
  Use the Quick Switch hotkey to instantly jump to the folder of the file you’re working with. Open files faster without manually navigating the Open File dialog.
