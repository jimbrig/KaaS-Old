## Highlights
- Dendron is my attempt at building a tool that will give humans access to and command over the inherited knowledge of the ages

- “We are overwhelmed with information and we don’t have the tools to properly index and filter through it. [The development of these tools, which] will give society access to and command over the inherited knowledge of the ages [should] be the first objective of our scientist” — Vannevar Bush, 1945
- Over 50 years ago, Vannevar Bush, an early visionary in information science, said something about the field that strikes a deep chord with me.
- I’ve also expanded my schemas and have migrated from free form bullets to a structured YAML syntax.

- By associating every note I took to a hierarchy, I found that looking up information no longer felt like an tax on my time, but instead, a path to self augmentation.

- I would use schemas as a common source of truth when building out a hierarchy and use them to make sure that each hierarchy was internally consistent. As I began to use this system day by day, I realized that I had stumbled upon a radically more effective way of learning.

- As I started building hierarchies across more and more domains, I found that it became useful to document what they were. I called these externalized hierarchies schemas. They were a table of contents for a particular hierarchy. I started adding a special schema file directly underneath the root of each hierarchy.

- And whereas folders were traditionally used to organize information, there was no straightforward way to use a folder hierarchy to quickly find information. Having the hierarchy in the filename made it easy to find information using the hierarchy

- But I didn’t want folders. Folders were messy and besides, weren’t supported in notational velocity, my primary note-taking tool at the time. So instead of folders, I decided to create a hierarchy using the . symbol as my delimiter.

- Take python as an example. Python is both a programming language as well as a cli command. Without changing the name of one of the notes or introducing folders, there would be no way to create notes on both.

- What started as a single markdown file quickly spawned a few hundred more. It was exhilarating — instead of turning to google every time I ran into a dusty corner of Linux, I could just reference my notes. 95% of the time, there would be a nicely summarized note waiting for me :)

- Note that my tar.md note doesn't have every option or use case involving tar. Instead, it's only the options that I find most useful and use cases that I've had to do. This tends to be my approach to note-taking - I like to capture the bare minimum information I need so that the future me can get value out of the note

- it lets me find any specific note within seconds even with thousands of existing notes
- My solution is something I call hierarchal note taking. It’s a system I’ve developed over the past ten years that has allowed me to amass a corpus of +10k notes.
- If I spent more than 5 minutes figuring something out, those are five minutes I never want to spend again figuring out the same problem
- My primary use for notes is as a cache. Think Redis, but for humans.
- I’ve expanded my use cases of note-taking beyond caching to also include journaling, task management, creating writing, keeping track of interactions, and lots more.
