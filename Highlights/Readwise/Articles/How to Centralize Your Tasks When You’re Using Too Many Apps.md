## Highlights
- Instead of working through tasks with intention, our days become a game of whack-a-mole as we try to keep up with all the tasks that pop up across our inboxes, calendars, and communication tools. At the end of the day, it’s hard to say whether we came out ahead or behind.
- Whittle your productivity stack down to the essentials
- Carl Pullein, a productivity and time management coach, provides a good rule of thumb: one app for one type of work. If you’re constantly forgetting where you saved a note, or checking multiple calendars for your next appointment, it’s probably time to reevaluate your current stack of productivity tools and whittle it down to a manageable size.
- A to-do list app
  A calendar app
  A note-taking app
  A writing app
  An email app
  A team messaging app
  A project management app
- start each day with one central “command center” that has the power to improve your productivity
