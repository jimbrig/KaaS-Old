## Highlights
- If your application runs on Docker, these certificates will have to be loaded into your container.
- These are usually enforced by the security team in your organization. Be aware of these and evaluate what your software might need beforehand.
- Your application might need client-certs to be installed on the machine to connect and trust remote HTTPS endpoints. Or if you are a server, you might require a server-cert signed by your organization’s root CA.
- Understand key concepts such as IP subnets, routing policies, firewall and DNS rules. These determine external connectivity — to and from your application.
- Most modern apps work by exposing HTTP APIs. The webserver that handles this needs to have limits set on important parameters like — incoming_payload_size, max_conncurrent_connectionsand connection-timeoutvalues.
