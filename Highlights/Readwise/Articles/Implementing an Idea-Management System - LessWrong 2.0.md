## Highlights
- The ideal idea-management system
  1. Separates ideas from commitments
  I want a system that separates obligations from ideas. Form follows function, so I’d prefer something that doesn’t structure ideas in lists. This rules out Todoist completely.
  2. Shows you the right ideas at the right time
  Even with complete foreknowledge, finding the perfect schedule might be practically impossible. In contrast, thinking on your feet and reacting as jobs come in won’t give you as perfect a schedule as if you’d seen into the future-but the best you can do is much easier to compute. — Algorithms to Live By
- 4. Allows you to break down ideas into smaller parts, and re-combine them as needed
  Tiago Forte’s Intermediate Packets inspired this. Many of our ideas can work in exactly the same way.
  5. Has low overhead
  You want to spend as little time as possible sorting and searching through your ideas. This should be a no-brainer. You want it to be easy to inter-link ideas and to add reference material. And when you get an idea on the train, you want to offload it without wasting time.
  Time for action
  Okay, Martin, I’m sold. But folders, task-managers, outliners like Workflowy and Dynalist — they’re all hierarchical!
  You’re rig
