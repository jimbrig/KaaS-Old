## Highlights
- Methods are functions which are specifically written for particular class
- Have a look at the sloop package, maintained by Hadley Wickham (that alone is a reason). Use the function s3_methods_generic to get a nice table with some relevant information:
- Percent formatting
  In the code snippet above I used the scales package’s percent function, which spares the formatting annoyance.
- Get your object’s size
  When I load a data, I often want to know how big is it. There is the basic object.size function but it’s ummm, ugly. Use the aptly named object_size function from the pryr package.
- Memory management
  Use the gc function; gc stands for garbage collection. It frees up memory by, well, collecting garbage objects from your workspace and trashing them. I at least, need to do this often.
- heta function
  I use the head and tail functions a lot, often as the first thing I do. Just eyeballing few lines helps to get a feel for the data. Default printing parameter for those function is 6 (lines) which is too much in my opinion.
- heta <- function(x, k= 3){
  cat("Head -- ","\n", "~~~~~", "\n")
  print(head(x, k))
  cat("Tail -- ","\n", "~~~~~", "\n")
  print(tail(x, k))
  }
- Sound the alarm
  If you stretch your model enough, you will have to wait until computation is done with. It is nice to get a sound notification for when you can continue working. A terrific way to do that is using the beepr package.
