## Highlights
- R and Shiny are popular tools to analyze data and visualize insights quickly. The single-threaded implementation of open-source R kernel constrains the scalability of R Shiny applications. Scaling R Shiny applications with commercial offerings may incur high licensing costs. The cloud-native implementation offers a cost-efficient solution to scale R Shiny applications.
- The R Shiny application can be scaled using a cloud-native architecture. Typically the nexts step are:
- Package the application code, its dependencies, and R Shiny Server for runtime into a Linux Docker image.
