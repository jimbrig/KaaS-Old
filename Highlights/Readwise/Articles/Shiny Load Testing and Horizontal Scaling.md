## Highlights
- We use the R package shinyloadtest provided by RStudio and the associated Java application shinycannon as load testing tools.
  The functionality of the tools can be explained by the figure above:
  The package shinyloadtest offers the possibility to open a shiny application and record a user session of any length. The recorded session can then be used for load testing by providing a link to the shinycannon application. A fixed number of users (so called „workers“) is specified, who try to execute the recorded session on the server as often as possible within a selected time period. Finally, a report can be generated from the collected data of the load test, which will be discussed in the next paragraph.
