## Highlights
- The autopilot schedule is a set of fixed times and locations for finishing your regular work each week. For example, you might decide to always tackle your history reading assignments Monday morning, from 9 am to 11 am, in the study carrels found on the 6th floor stacks of the main library.
  The shadow course, described below, is a simple optimization to the autopilot schedule that can generate huge benefits.
- I recommend that you choose the most exotic possible location for your weekly shadow course time blocks
- To make things even better, because this time is spread out across an autopilot schedule, these hours all maintain a high intensity of focus â€” a feat which would be impossible if this time was condensed into a small number of long study session.
