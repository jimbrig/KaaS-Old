## Highlights
- Windows key + X
- You can click on a title letter in the "All apps" list from the Start Menu which triggers a nice zoom-out animation and displays the alphabet for quick access to a specific letter
- You can narrow down search results to a single type (like files) by first typing the name of the section followed by a colon. For example:
  files:jqu <-- this would find jquery files.
  This works for basically all section headers (apps: settings: web: folders: etc)
- Win+Ctrl+D to create new virtual desktop
- Win+Crtl+F4 to close the current virtual desktop.
- Win+Ctrl+Left/Right arrow to quickly switch between desktops,
