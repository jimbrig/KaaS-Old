## Highlights
- When you feel like procrastinating, chances are you’re pondering over how much effort a certain task or activity will cost you. In other words, you’re focused on the short-term ‘pain’ of taking action. This short-term focus is a key characteristic of chronic procrastinators.
- The most disciplined people, on the other hand, shift their minds away from the short-term effort it costs them and instead focus on the long-term results their actions will bring them.
- We must all suffer from one of two pains: the pain of discipline or the pain of regret. The difference is discipline weighs ounces while regret weighs tons.” — Jim Rohn
