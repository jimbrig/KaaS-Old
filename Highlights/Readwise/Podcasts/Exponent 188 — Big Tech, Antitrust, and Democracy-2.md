## Highlights
- in a way, because obviously I've been sort of fixated on the APP store for literally since the beginning trajectory. Like what in my first set of articles back in 2013 was trying to understand what happens. Do you think that's a crappy job managing the APP store and one of my conclusions? There was, you know, there. So scarred from their near death experience in the nineties, when they had to bag Adobe and Microsoft to continue supporting the max, it could remain viable. And I wrote this back in 2013 that they would never allow themselves to be in that position again. And ([Time 0:02:06](https://www.airr.io/quote/5f372560a7c7e09e7d99a8a1))
    - Note: Apple’s management policy for the AppStore can be traced back to the company getting scarred by Adobe & Microsoft in the 90s
