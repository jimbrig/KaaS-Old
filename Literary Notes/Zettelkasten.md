# Zettelkasten

Zettelkasten describes a method of [[Personal Knowledge Management]], or PKM, inspired by the prolific sociologist [[Niklas Luhmann]].

## Principles

> Principles are higher than techniques. Principles produce techniques in an instant.  
—Ido Portal

- [[Principle of Atomicity]]: put things that belong together into a single note, [give it an ID](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/add-identity/), but limit its content to that single topic.
- [[Principle of Connectivity]]: how different techniques can implement the same underlying principle - links versus note sequences

## Knowledge Management

[The building blocks of a Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/zettelkasten-building-blocks/) are the **Inbox**, the **Note Archive** or **Slipbox**, and the **Reference Manager**.

These are the basics to get started with effective knowledge management:

-   [Use a real notebook](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/use-real-notebook/) to capture thoughts.
-   Write notes for your note archive [in a way you understand later.](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/how-to-write-notes-you-can-understand/)
-   [Add Identity](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/add-identity/) to things in the system to make references possible.
-   [Don’t use categories.](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/no-categories/) Use tags instead.
    -   [Good and bad tags](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/object-tags-vs-topic-tags/) explained: some tagging habits will get in your way eventually.
-   [Set links between notes.](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/search-alone-is-not-enough) Search alone is not enough.
-   Every Zettel has two forms: [an inner and outer form](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/zettel-nature-two-forms/).

And always keep in mind [The Collector’s Fallacy](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/collectors-fallacy/): you have to work with new material to really learn it. It doesn’t suffice to bookmark websites or just read and annotate books. (Christian still has [skeletons in the closet](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/collectors-fallacy-confession/).)

To get you in the mood to grow your archive, read [“Trust the process”](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/trust-the-process-nickmilo22/), an essay.

## Scaling the Zettelkasten

To cope with the constant influx of new information, [use temporary “buffer” notes](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/buffer-notes/) to collect stuff that you can later re-arrange.

With time, you’ll notice multiple [Layers of Evidence](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/layers-of-evidence/) emerge. This means your notes will have different kinds of content. The layers are:

1.  Data description and patterns.
2.  Interpretation of descriptions and patterns.
3.  Synthesis of patterns, descriptions and interpretation.

When your archive grows, you’ll add [Structural Layers in your Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/three-layers-structure-zettelkasten/) through links. The levels are:

1.  Bottom Layer: Content
2.  Middle Layer: Structure Notes
3.  Top Layer: Main Structure Notes and Double Hashes (that is: special tags)

## Resources

### Learning

[“Trust the process”](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/trust-the-process-nickmilo22/) (an essay) hits the nerve: thinking and memory retention are improved by working through problems.

-   [A Zettelkasten improves your thinking and writing](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/zettelkasten-improves-thinking-writing/) because it surprises us when we search for something.
-   [A Zettelkasten extends your mind and memory](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/extend-your-mind-and-memory-with-a-zettelkasten/) because its structure mimics the way your brain works.
-   [Learn faster](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/learn-faster-by-writing-zettel-notes/): get coverage with good reading techniques, get practice by writing Zettel notes, and gain insights by connecting notes to your web of knowledge.
-   You have to [interpret your sources](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/dont-rely-on-source-have-faith-in-yourself/) and then rely on your own thoughts henceforth to get the maximum benefit.

### Writing

-   [Make writing a part of your identity](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/identity-schedule-serious-writing/). This requires to schedule time for writing, and to create lasting habits.
-   How to become a better writer:
    -   A [daily writing practice](https://christiantietze.de/posts/2013/12/useful-daily-writing-practice/) will help lower the hurdle to get started, for example.
    -   [How to track your writing progress](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/how-to-track-writing-progress/) – define metrics and find out how well you perform.
    -   [Counting your words](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/count-your-words/) is motivating and helps you stick to the habit of writing daily.
    -   Christian also wrote a Mac app for this: the [Word Counter](http://wordcounterapp.com/).
-   Getting started with writing projects:
    -   Buffer files in your Zettelkasten are great to [store writing ideas](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/manage-writing-ideas/).
    -   [Use outlines](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/how-i-use-outlines-to-write-any-text/) to start with the first draft, and then
    -   [ease into writing](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/ease-into-writing/) by adding Zettel notes to the outline, pasting their contents. This works [without you trying so hard.](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/write-book-without-even-trying-so-hard/)
-   [Divide composing from editing your texts](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/writing-composing-revising/) to reach a state of flow and get faster at finishing your projects.
-   [Publish iteratively](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/publish-iteratively/).
-   Field Report: [A PhD About Writing with His Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/henrik-zettelkasten-paper-submission/). Henrik talks about his process from draft to submission, to revision, to being accepted in a journal.

### Reading

-   [Create a bibliography](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/bibliography-zettelkasten/) as part of your toolkit. It’s a permanent companion and keeps track of your sources of information.
-   The [Barbell Method of Reading](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/barbell-method-reading/) explains how to get most out of any text. Read thoroughly and invest more time (risky investment) when necessary, stick to quickly skimming (low risk) for the rest.
-   [Reading for the Zettelkasten is searching](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/reading-is-searching/): next time you tackle a long text, try to look for very specific kinds of information that lend themselves to being extracted.
-   Reading on paper
    -   [Make proper reading marks](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/making-proper-marks-in-books/) instead of leaving annotations in the margin.
    -   You should [take reading notes instead](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/reading-putting-it-all-together/). Get the stuff _out_ of the book. (This is closely related to the [Collector’s Fallacy](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/collectors-fallacy/).)
    -   [Create Zettel from reading notes](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/create-zettel-from-reading-notes/) afterwards.
-   Reading online
    -   [How to read on the web efficiently](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/reading-web-rss-note-taking/), using and managing RSS feed subscriptions.

## History of Zettelkasten

If you want to know more about the history of the Zettelkasten Method, check out the [ongoing research on Luhmann’s Zettelkasten by Johannes Schmidt](https://niklas-luhmann-archiv.de/projekt/publikationen) at Bielefeld University. Johannes is the _Guardian of the Godfather’s Zettelkasten_, and his work is genuinely interesting for knowledge work nerds.

We also cover the relevant bit of history in [our introduction](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction) to explain how the Zettelkasten Method works.
