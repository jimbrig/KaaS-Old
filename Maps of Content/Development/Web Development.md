## Content Management System (CMS)

Content management systems: Can’t live with them, can’t live without them. We asked developers to tell us a lot about CMSes: Whether they were aware of them, whether they used them, and whether they wanted to use them more or less.

We turned the ratio of “people who want to use it more” vs. “people who want to use it less” into something we call our “satisfaction score,” and you’ll see us use it a few times.

A score of less than one in “satisfaction” means more people want to stop using a technology than want to continue using it.

If you compare usage against satisfaction, you begin to see some clear takeaways:

-   WordPress is a clear leader as a content management system, but it is not well-loved, with a score of 0.3, significantly less than 1. However, using WordPress as a [headless](https://jamstack.org/glossary/headless-technology/) content manager to a hosting provider like Netlify, while less common, is an arrangement with a much higher satisfaction score.
-   Several well-known content management systems have scores well below one.
