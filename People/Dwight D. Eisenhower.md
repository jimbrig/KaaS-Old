# Dwight D. Eisenhower

*Source: Book written by Eisenhower's Granddaughter*

On a regular basis, Eisenhower would take out a piece of paper and perform what a GTD'ist would call a *[[Mindsweep]]*. He would write down all of the things on his mind, what is bothering him, what commitments he was dedicated to, etc.. 

Next, Eisenhower would simply crumble up the paper and toss it into the trashcan, purposefully making it a great accomplishment to make the shot and therefore successfully remove those thoughts, worries, anxieties, and feelings of overwhelm out of him mind and into the trash!
