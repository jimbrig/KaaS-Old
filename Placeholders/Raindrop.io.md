## About Raindrop.io

In our fast-moving world, bookmarks bar no longer the best place for ideas, inspiration and knowledge. Your browser doesn’t give you tools to organize and resurface things you’ve saved. Even worse, you can’t access them outside of a particular ecosystem.

Raindrop.io's goal is to improve how teams and individuals deal with their bookmarks. We want to bring back a passion for collecting!

## Collect Everything in One Place

Raindrop.io is the best place to keep all your favorite books, songs, articles or whatever else you come across while browsing.
