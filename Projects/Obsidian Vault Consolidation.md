# Obsidian Vault Consolidation

## Desired Outcome

Desired Outcome is a unified central knowledge store that merges and assimilates the various markdown notes scattered across all of my current and previous [[Obsidian]] Vaults. Additionally, I want to be able to a) display the vault on GitHub using GitHub Flavored Markdown and b) publish certain aspects of the vault to be available to the public as a website.

## Next Actions

- [ ] List all currently available Obsidian Vaults
