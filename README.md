# KaaS - Knowledge as a Service

[![Deploy with MkDocs](https://github.com/jimbrig/KaaS/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jimbrig/KaaS/actions/workflows/deploy.yml)

Welcome to my personal knowledge base - **KaaS** or Knowledge as a Service.

Inside is my personal, customized, digital knowledge notebase structured loosely as a [[Zettelkasten]], a collection of interlinked [[Atomic Notes]] about anything that interests me.

Consider this my *Digital Garden*. It is a garden that needs to be maintained and cared for overtime to produce fruitful outcomes.
