# KaaS - Knowledge as a Service

[![Deploy with MkDocs](https://github.com/jimbrig/KaaS/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jimbrig/KaaS/actions/workflows/deploy.yml)

Welcome to my personal knowledge base - **KaaS** or Knowledge as a Service.

Inside is my personal, customized, digital knowledge note-base structured loosely as a *[[Zettelkasten]]*, a collection of interlinked *[[Atomic Notes]]* about anything that interests me.

Consider this my *Digital Garden*. It is a garden that needs to be maintained and cared for overtime to produce fruitful outcomes.

## Roadmap

Currently I am persistently perusing and curating my 10,000+ various notes houses across various platforms and locations: I would say I am about **18%** complete in this endeavor.


## Where Next?

Check out the `Meta/` Folder for details about this Vault and its setup:

- [[About]]
- [[Publish Workflow]] *(MkDocs version only, not Obsidian Publish)*
- [[Structure]]
- [[Plugins]]
- [[Tags]]

The [[Changelog]] is also a good *Meta* resource.

### Maps of Content

If this vault serves as my version of [[Building a Second Brain|a second brain]], then [[Maps of Content/README|Maps of Content]] or *MOC's* are the underlying [[Synapse]]'s connecting the neurotransmitters of the brain together to form a complex, structured system. 

In other words MOC's serve as structural, index notes that list related [[Atomic Notes]] in a single location.

Some Maps of Content to consider are:

- [[Development]]
- [[Web Development]]
- [[Microsoft Azure]]

The others are still works in progress as I collect and curate more notes into the vault.
