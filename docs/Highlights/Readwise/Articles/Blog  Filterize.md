## Highlights
- Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them (David Allen)
- The Top Five Benefits from using Getting Things Done
  1.) The most important task of the GTD method is to collect all your ideas, material, and todos into one inbox. As soon as you trust your inbox and your system, your brain stops to remind your every few seconds on random things. Instead, it will relieve you of the mental workload of reminding everything. This helps you to get a clear mind and focus on your progress.
  2.) If you write down all your thought, nothing get lost anymore. Everything is in the system and you can be sure to have access to it in the right moment. Whenever you need it.
  3.) During the weekly and monthly review, you go through all your open tasks, project and ideas. This allows you to plan what are the next actions to do. Due to nature of breaking all bigger tasks down to small actionable pieces it is much easier to really do them. This is an import step to overcome procrastination.
  4.) Most systems require the usage of priorities. This is a really hard task. For example, if you have five priorities P1, P2, … P5 you have to decide for every single task if it is a P3 or maybe a P2. With Getting Things Done you don’t have to invest this thought. Instead you can organize your tasks into contexts like home, work, or town. With this contexts you will only see actions you can do right now.
  5.) Getting Things Done combines perfectly with the Inbox Zero. With Inbox Zero you have the goal to reduce all items in your inbox to zero. With the GTD system you have the perfect way to achieve this.
- If you use Evernote for your Getting Things Done implementation you can easily transform actionable items into reference material, whenever you finish a task.
- You can use your email application to forward emails as reference material or actionable items directly into Evernote. You can use the webclipper to collect interesting web pages or you can setup your scanner to send scanned documents directly into your Evernote inbox.
- Automated Dashboard Notes
  With Filterize you can create dashboards for your contexts, projects or your delegated list. Dashboards are notes with dynamic tables of contents. With our predefined Getting Things Done Workflow you can have notes that organize your tasks by urgency like now, next or later with respect to the tasks context.
- Delegate Tasks to Users without Evernote
  You can define a rule in Filterize that sends an email to your colleague whenever a note has a certain tag. If you use tag to identify the person you want to delegate the task to you can use this rule to inform him/her about the delegated task.
- Support for your Weekly and Monthly Review
  One of the most important tasks in Getting Things Done is to do your weekly and monthly review to keep your GTD system working. The easiest way to do this is to create a checklist for both of them. You can apply a reminder to the review notes, so Evernote reminds you whenever the review is due.
  If you prepare the next review, you have to uncheck all checkboxes of your checklist and reschedule the reminder to the next week or month. Filterize can automate this completely. Just setup a filter that unchecks your checkboxes and create a new reminder in a month or week. You can trigger this automation with the last open checkbox in your review checklist.
