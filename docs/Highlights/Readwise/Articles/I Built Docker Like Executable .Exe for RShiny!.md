## Highlights
- It pastes latest packages and executes around 50 lines of code before launching the tool in this artificial environment. With 100% success rate.
- There’s an outer layer of a bash script that prepares the system. The script checks for environment variables, whether or not R is installed on the system and pastes .Renviron and .Rprofile files among other dependent files on the client system.
