## Highlights
- general subscriptions on people’s blogs, and a number of del.icio.us feeds of those same people, and subscriptions to a few mainstream media sources for headline news,
- a ‘keeping track’ section, with feeds from blogs, fora, wiki’s, and bookmark collections of communities I directly participate in, so I know what is going on in those specific groups. Also a feed with most recent Flickr uploads from my contacts is in this group,
- a ‘tracking tags’ section, to which I add feeds for different topics (at the moment web2.0, long tail, personal knowledge management, innovation and the like) from Technorati, Flickr, and del.icio.us. This brings a general picture (also through the number of daily results) of what is happening around a specific theme,
- a ‘clients’ section which contains RSS feeds of clients I work with, so I know what is happening, and stay in touch with their context also when we are not directly in touch all the time.
- During the browsing I drag parts that draw my interest into Qumana via the drop pad. (for later publishing, writing) and into my wiki (for filing or further processing) on a page called BlogsDailyRoundUp. Observations or sudden ideas that come to me through browsing end up in that wiki-page as well. Entries in the BlogsDailyRoundUp page usually have formats like:
  put in delicious [account] [url] (account being my own, my company’s delicious account or that of a community I partake in)
  comment at [name]’s about [topic] [url]
  follow up reading [entry] at [url] (meaning go check out the links in that posting: I read off-line remember)
  file [quote] from [url]
  mail [name] about [topic] [url]
  Basically I am building a To Do list based on what I read in my RSS reader. The things I want to blog or write about go into Qumana, where they basically form a list “Things to Possibly Write About”
- E-mail
  E-mail I read througout the day, and may result in tasks in which case they end up in the calendar or in the wiki. I hardly have any e-mail list services I use left. Less than 5. One for my old fraternity, one for a local community, and one or two for professional discussions. In those last two I do not actively participate any longer.
