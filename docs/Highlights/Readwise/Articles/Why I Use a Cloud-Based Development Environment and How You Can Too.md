- A core principle of mine is productivity. Anything I can automate, I automate. Anything I can get rid of, I get rid of. Anything I can outsource, I outsource. If I can drop my local development environment, I do so. As soon as you work in a team, all your effort of setting up a local development environment instantly multiplies by the number of team members. I’d much rather not have to deal with that for every new team member that joins and have them started with a fully functioning development environment within minutes. Who’s worked in a team where the most recent developer who joins updates the “Development environment setup” wiki page only to find it outdated by the time the next team member joins? Be honest with yourself when you answer that 😉. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1353723328/14361624))
